OpenSource code collected by the j3d.org site for use in various applications
that need 3D graphics utilities but without being renderer-specific.
</p>

<p>
The licensing here is using the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A>
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</A> v2.1. We wish you to use
this code and contribute back any changes you made to the community. This site
is, after all, driven by the community of Java3D hackers. Everything here is
volunteered, either through posts to the Java3D interest list or directly to
the site.
</p>

<p>
The code collection consists of a number of fundamental areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Geometry</li>
<li>Device Implementations</li>
<li>User Interface components</li>
<li>Various file format loaders</li>
</ul>

<p>
In general the code tries to have two versions of each piece of functionality.
A low-level implementation provides the basic abstraction and functionality and
is not dependent on Java3D to function. A second, higher-level implementation
then takes the basic code and provides Java3D-specific functionality. By doing
this, it allows the majority of the codebase to be useful for more than just 
Java3D work. Standalone users or other rendering technologies can make use of
most of the fundamental capabilities without needing to be dependent on Java3D.
