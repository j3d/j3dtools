Classes for parsing and loading AC3D files v3.0 and later.
<P>

Ac3dLoader was originally written as two separate projects. The first project
was a general purpose AC3D file parser that loaded the flat file into a
hierarchical model for general-purpose use. The second project was the
<CODE>Ac3dLoader</CODE> implementation, which essentially just provides
mapping of the model generated in the parser to their Java 3D representation.
Although both projects have been merged into the single Ac3dLoader project,
the separate parsing functionality is still available.
