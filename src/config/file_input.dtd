<!--
   This simple DTD describes file input information for the j3d.org 
   FileInputDevice implementation. A very simple form, it just says to 
   have X sensors and then defines the data points for each sensor.

<!ELEMENT input_data "(sensors_data)+">

<!-- 
  Describes the list of sensor information. The number is how many sensor
  objects we should use. Allows us to define extras and not use them in testing

<!--
   Description of an individual sensor. The coordinates are defines as being a
   series of 3 points in the PCDATA of this element. The index is the sensor

   time is the amount of time for a single loop - in seconds (fractions
   permitted). Loops is the number of loops to perform. 0 says to not loop.
