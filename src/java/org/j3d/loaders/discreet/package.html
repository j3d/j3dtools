Classes for parsing Discreet's 3DS Max .3ds file format.
<p>

A parser that handles the raw structural information of the file and returns
objects that correspond to the structure. No attempt is made to change the 
raw values as reported by the file except for colours. All colour values are
normalised to a 3-component float value. 3DS likes to dump invalid colour 
values with ranges outside the normal [0,1] range, but we leave anything like
that as is.
<p>

If you need something that reads to a form that is renderable by a rendering
engine, you will need to visit the various renderer-specific packages under
<code>org.j3d.renderer.<i>renderer_name</i>.loaders</code>.
