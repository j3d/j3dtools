User interface components and capabilities for implementing simple navigation
on any Canvas 3D.
<P>

The classes here are designed to work with any {@link javax.media.j3d.Canvas3D}
to provide fast navigation. These classes do not use the standard behaviour
mechanism, instead opting to get the updates directly from the Java AWT system
instead.
<P>

Apart from the basic navigation code, a set of convenience toolbars are
provided that interact with the normal world. These use images from the
config area in the <CODE>navigation</CODE> sub-directory. Once this code is
working nicely, some examples and nice looking pictures will be added here.
<P>

This code is based on the work of the Norwegian Institutt for energiteknikk.
The code provided <A HREF="http://www.external.hrp.no/vr/">there</A> has been
cleaned up dramatically and made more suitable to use as a general library.
Regardless, many thanks go to Laszlo Seregi and the team there for providing
this codebase!
