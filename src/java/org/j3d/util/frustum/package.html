Generalised utility classes for all representing view frustum information
<P>

The aim of this package is to provide an abstract representation of a view
frustum for many different styles of application and algorithms.
<p>

The view frustum code uses features that are specific to Java3D 1.3 to access
view projection matrix information.
<p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

The way the view frustum is implemented means that you will have a one frame
delay between where your user code is at and where the view frustum is
pointing. This is because it queries the Canvas3D and that query returns the
projection matrix information for the last frame rendered, not the current
settings. If you are doing jump cuts between locations, that can result in
wildly inaccurate values.
<p>

To try to cope with some of these problems, a utility method is available to
manually re-orientate the view frustum. The idea is that user code will move
the viewpoint transformations, request the VWorld transformation matrix back
and then apply that to the view frustum to give you a better idea of where the
user is now going to be pointing in this frame. That should give more accurate
results in the visual output over time.

Sun Microsystems.
