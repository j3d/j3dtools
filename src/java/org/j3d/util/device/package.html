Utility classes for managing and loading various different types of devices.
<P>

The package is used for providing an application independent system for
managing the various Java 3D devices type AudioDevice, InputDevice and Loader.
The manager provides implementation independance by using abstract
descriptor classes rather than providing direct instances of the individual
devices. It should also be used with the {@link org.j3d.ui} package to give
a consistent user interface.
