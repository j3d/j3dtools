Generalised classes describing humanioid figures that are compliant with the
<a href="http://h-anim.org/Specifications/H-Anim1.1/">H-Anim 1.1</a> 
specification.
<P>

The nodes in this class represent a generic humanoid figure that can be 
represented as either a skinned mesh or articulated figures. The rendering
of the individual figures is left to the particular rendering API in separate
packages. 
<p>

This package diverges from the basic H-Anim spec by providing two different
classes that represent the skinned or articulated versions of the figures. 
By separating them, implementations can optimise the rendering significantly.
