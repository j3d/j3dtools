Generalised classes for providing particle systems in Java3D environments.
<P>

Particle systems are used to provide lots of visual effects like smoke and
water in a 3D environment. This generalised system provides the basic
mechanics and also a collection of pre-built functions for controlling and
rendering particles.
<P>

Currently the code is considered Alpha. It works, but there are quite a
few fixed things in the code that need to be made configurable. In addition
a lot more documentation work needs to be done.
<P>

The code in this package is provided by Daniel Selman of Tornado Labs.
