Class for processing and generating terrain type geometry
<P>

The classes here are specifically aimed at the various tasks someone wanting
to use or generate terrain information in their application. The code contains
everything from a generic elevation grid creator to a fractal terrain
generator.

<H3>Using the code</H3>

The classes here fit with the basic infrastructure defined in the parent
package {@link org.j3d.geom} for the generator utilities. In addition to
these, we add colorising capabilities. An example of all of the classes
combined together can be seen in the following image.

The image is of the example terrain generator demo application included as
part of the CVS module. you can see the parameters used for the
{@link org.j3d.geom.terrain.FractalTerrainGenerator} on the right. In
addition to this, it is using a
{@link org.j3d.geom.terrain.ColorRampGenerator color ramp filter}
with the following heights set.
