/**
 * An overlay that is used like an ordinary drawing canvas that interacts with
 * the mouse.
 * <P>
 *
 * This class registers a behavior with the given scenegraph that listens for
 * all mouse events. You can use the constructor to filter for motion and
 * ordinary mouse events and turn these on and off at will.
 * <P>
 *
 * Mouse overlays will generate events for the entire canvas regardless of
 * whether the user sets the canvas to a smaller value. Ideally, the user
 * should find the canvas, ask for the size of it and then use that to set
 * the width and height of the underlying texture. Remember that texture
 * ccordinates are changed to a power of two, so texture drawing coordinates
 * probably will not match the mouse screen coordinates. You should use the
 * two provided coordinate convertors to swap between the two systems if you
 * wish for the drawn items to match the actual mouse locations.
 * <P>
 *
 * <B>Note:</B> This class does not call the <CODE>repaint()</CODE> method
 * after each mouse event. It is the responsibility of the derived class to
 * make sure the screen gets updated with any information regarding the mouse
 * event.
