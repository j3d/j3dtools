/**
 * An overlay is rectangular texture which is aligned with the image plate
 * giving the illusion of an image drawn onto the canvas rather than in the
 * scene.
 * <p>
 * In an accelerated environment the scene is drawn on the card and goes
 * directly from there onto the screen. In order to draw directly over the
 * scene it must be rendered, then transfered to the system memory, drawn on,
 * then tranfered back.
 * Each of these transfers take place on the bus between the card and the system
 * which is already busy with the normal operations of displaying everything not
 * 3d on the screen. Using a texture that is placed in front of the image plate
 * is a much cheaper operation. It just requires transering the data to the card
 * once (as oppoased to the whole scene back and forth across the bus for each
 * frame.) Also OverlayBase which is the default implementation of this interface
 * is double buffered so the transfer takes place in the background and once the
 * entire texture make it onto the card it is made active.
 * <p>
 * Creating a new Overlay is very simple. Simply override paint(Graphics2D g) in
 * OverlayBase. If you have an overlay that is changing with time calling repaint()
 * will update it.
 * <p>
 * As a note: Displaying large overlays use a *huge* amount of texture memory.
 * Every pixel in the overlay is represented by a set of integers (3 or 4 depending
 * on if the overlay has a transparency value (RGB vs RGBA.) For a 512x128 alpha
 * capable overlay that is (4 * 512 * 128) / 1024 = 256Kb of memory. Each texture
 * has 3 buffers though, one in system memory and two on the card so the actual
 * memory used is 256Kb * 3 = 768Kb. A 512x512 overlay would take 3072Kb or 3Mb.
 * <p>
 * Another thing to realize is that textures have to have dimesions that are powers
 * of two for optimization purposes. This means a 513x257 texture would require
 * 1024x512 of bounds to be allocated. Unlike most textures, overlays cannot
 * tolerate stretching and interpolation because of the fuzzyness that results.
 * The overlay system breaks the requested overlaysize up into smaller pieces
 * so that extra texture memory is not wasted. This is hidden from the user who
 * simply sees a graphics context for the entire overlay. When the entire buffer
 * has been drawn though it is divided appropriately onto the SubOverlay's which
 * are positioned so as to look like one solid rectangle.
 * <p>
 * Updates to the actual textures are done within a behavior within a frame. This
 * is very fast because all that is happening is that the buffers are getting
 * swapped. We have to be certain that we are not in the process of copying the big
 * buffer into the back buffer at the same time the behavior attempts to do a buffer
 * swap. This is handled by the overlay by not updating texture if we are in the
 * middle of drawing a new one. The drawback to this is that numerous updates per
 * second to the overlay could result in several updates not get immediately
 * reflected. But since the area is always completely redrawn this should not prove
 * to be an issue. Soon as we hit a frame where we are not updating the buffer then
 * it will be swapped.
 * <p>
 * Remember, all you have to do to make translucent or non-square overlays is to use
 * the alpha channel.
