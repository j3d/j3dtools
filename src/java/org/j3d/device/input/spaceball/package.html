Implementations of InputDevices suitable for Spaceballs.
<P>

Spaceballs use either serial or parallel ports to handling information.
These drivers therefore require the JavaCOMM API in order to compile.
<P>

The code has been tested with the Spaceball4000. Code is included for
Spaceball3000 and 2300 models, but is not yet tested.
