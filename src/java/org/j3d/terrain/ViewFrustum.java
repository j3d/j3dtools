/**
 * A utility for tracking the ViewFrustum planes and determining if
 * a triangle or point is visible.
 * <p>
 *
 * Because Java3D can have multiple canvases that view a single scenegraph,
 * the view frustum must be a bit more complex than the traditional case. It
 * must take into account that every canvas has its own viewplatform, and they
 * may not be looking at the same thing. That means, for culling, they will
 * need to assemble the union of all the spaces for each canvas.
 * <p>
 *
 * The frustum is for the previous Java3D frame that has just been rendered.
