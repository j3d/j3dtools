/**
 * Representation of a piece of rendered terrain data.
 * <p>
 *
 * The landscape is used to control what it rendered on screen as the user
 * moves about the virtual environment. This instance does not need to maintain
 * all the polygons on the screen at any one time, but may control them as
 * needed.
 * <p>
 *
 * This object is independent of the culling algorithm. It represents something
 * that can be placed in a scenegraph and have view information passed to it
 * without the need to know the specific algorithm in use. To implement a
 * specific algorithm (eg ROAM) you would extend this class and implement the
 * {@link #setView(Tuple3f, Vector3f)} method. Every time that the scene
 * changes, you will be notified by this method. That means you should perform
 * any culling/LOD and update the scene graph at this point. This will be
 * called at most once per frame.
 * <p>
 *
 * For convenience, this class also implements {@link FrameUpdateListener} from
 * the {@link org.j3d.ui.navigation} package so that you can have fast, quick
 * navigation implementation in your code. If you wish to use your own custom
 * user input code, then there is no penalty for doing so. Simply call one of
 * the <code>setView()</code> methods directly with the transformation
 * information.
 * <p>
 *
 * If you are going to use this class with the navigation code, then you
 * should also make the internal geometry not pickable, and make this item
 * pickable. In this way, the navigation code will find this top-level
 * terrain definition and use it directly to make the code much faster. None
 * of these capabilities are set within this implementation, so it is up to
 * the third-party code to make it so via calls to the appropriate methods.
