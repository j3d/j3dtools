Generalised utility classes for all terrain culling algorithms.
<P>

The aim of this package is to provide an abstract representation of any
landscape rendering system. They all operate on a set of basic principles of
a basic change in detail dependent on the viewer position, encapsulation of
terrain information and the view information. While this package does not
provide any hints to the implementation of a particular algorithm, it can
be used to represent all of them in a general sense. Each algorithm extends
this basic package with their own specific code.

<H3>Implementing a terrain rendering algorithm</H3>

In order to implement a new algorithm, your attention is focussed on two
classes in this package - {@link org.j3d.terrain.TerrainData} and
{@link org.j3d.terrain.Landscape}. The former is used to represent the
raw data of the terrain in a generic sense, it is based on a regular grid
structure. The later is access point for adding the terrain into the
scene graph. Renderable items go in here.
<p>

Raw terrain information you probably don't need to implement most of the time.
The repository codebase also includes a number of loaders for different file
formats as well as a generalised implementation of the <code>TerrainData</code>
class that works with these loaders. For most simple cases, you should not
need to do anything more. For more information on this code, have a look at the
{@link org.j3d.loaders} package.
<p>

To implement a specific algorithm (eg ROAM) you would extend the
{@link org.j3d.terrain.Landscape} class and implement the
{@link org.j3d.terrain.Landscape#setView(javax.vecmath.Tuple3f, javax.vecmath.Vector3f)}
method. Every time that the user's viewpoint changes, you will be notified
by this method (assuming that you have implemented a navigation system that
calls it!). That means you should perform
any culling/LOD and update the scene graph at this point. This will be
called at most once per frame. As this class extends the Java3D
{@link javax.media.j3d.BranchGroup} interface, it means that all your geometry
of the scene should be added to this class.
<p>

For convenience, this class also implements
{@link org.j3d.ui.navigation.FrameUpdateListener} from the
{@link org.j3d.ui.navigation} package so that you can have fast, quick
navigation implementation in your code. If you wish to use your own custom
user input code, then there is no penalty for doing so. Simply call one of
the <code>setView()</code> methods directly with the transformation
information.

<H3>Coordinate Systems</H3>

There are multiple coordinate systems within the terrain rendering package and
they don't all match. Apart from the traditional 3D graphics system, there is
is the grid of the height values provided through the
{@link org.j3d.terrain.TerrainData} interface. For some cases, where the
height values cover a very large area, we may manage the terrain grid in larger
chunks called tiles. Tiles also have their own coordinate system, which is
overlaid on height values, as shown below.
<p>

Because terrain data may be effectively endless, both tile and grid systems
will allow negative coordinates. This matches with map of the earth coordinate
systems where you have an origin and then values positive and negative relative
to that (eg UTM).
