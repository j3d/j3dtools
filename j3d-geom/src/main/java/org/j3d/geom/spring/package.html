Implementation of a Spring system for modelling system dynamics.
<P>

Springs are useful for modelling cloth-type surfaces to show the interactions
between the individual points of a surface. Most of the code was inspired by
the utilities from the Humus OpenGL demo suit. For more info on that, head over
